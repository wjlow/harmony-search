Implementation of LNCS 4448 - Music Composition Using Harmony Search Algorithm

I still need to implement mutation to this (applying pitch changes, etc.). Current implementation creates a new random harmony each iteration. 

This also serves as an excuse to try using val for defining my functions so they look more Haskell-like.
